## \#\# Getting Started (Local Setup)

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing. This guide uses a `.env` file to manage secret keys and other settings, which should never be committed to Git.

### \#\#\# Prerequisites

  * Python 3.8+
  * Git

### \#\#\# Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

      * On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
      * On Windows:
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    First, you need a small package to read the `.env` file.

    ```bash
    pip install python-dotenv
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Update `settings.py` to Load the `.env` File**
    Add the following two lines to the very top of your `account_log/settings.py` file. This will load your `.env` file automatically every time the application starts.

    ```python
    # At the top of account_log/settings.py
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    load_dotenv()

    import os
    import dj_database_url
    from pathlib import Path
    # ... rest of the file
    ```

5.  **Create Your Local `.env` File**
    In the root of your project (the same folder as `manage.py`), create a file named `.env`. Copy and paste the following, replacing the placeholder values with your own keys.

    ```env
    # Django Settings
    # Generate a new secret key for development. Do not use the production key.
    SECRET_KEY='django-insecure-a-very-strong-local-secret-key'
    DEBUG='True'

    # Database URL (uses the local SQLite file by default)
    DATABASE_URL='sqlite:///db.sqlite3'

    # Your Cloudinary Credentials (get from your Cloudinary dashboard)
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME='your_cloud_name'
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY='your_api_key'
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET='your_api_secret'
    ```

6.  **IMPORTANT: Secure Your Secrets**
    Your `.env` file contains sensitive information. It must **never** be committed to GitHub. Create or open the `.gitignore` file in your project root and add `.env` to it.

    ```
    # .gitignore

    # Environment variables
    .env

    # Other files...
    db.sqlite3
    ```

7.  **Run Database Migrations**

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

8.  **Run the Development Server**

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

    Your application will now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, configured with the settings from your `.env` file.
